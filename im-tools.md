# NGA IM Tools
This document attempts to list and describe all of the systems and tools in use for Information Management at the NGA LTER site.

## The Research Workspace
 Write a narrative about the RW. 
  - What is it? 
  - How does NGA LTER uses it?
  - Who has access to it?
  - When do we use other tools and how do we decide that's the right thing to do?

## Repositories
### The Research Workspace DataONE Member Node
Research Workspace. DataONE. Member Node.
### EDI
Ecological Data Initiative Data Repository. Most of the other LTER data is here.
### Pangaea
Will Burt and Ben Lowin archived some things here.

## Data Portals
### NGA LTER Data Portal
The DataONE Custom Portal
### AOOS Ocean Data Explorer
For model results and data that's also a part of the EVOSTC's Gulf Watch Alaska program.

## Github
### nga-lter
The NGA site github organization. This is an umbrella for connecting all of the repos that any of us use for data munging or analysis, metadata generation, documentation, etc. If you have a repo that's associated with your NGA work, add it to the organization.
### nga-im-docs
This is the repo full of markdown docs describing NGA IM tools and processes. This is a collection of living docs that is very much in progress now, but will eventually be the place to find answers to your NGA Information Management questions.

## Jira and Confluence
### Jira
Axiom uses Jira, an issue tracket from Atlassian, internally for task management and project management. All of the NGA LTER datasets and IM tasks are represented as tickets on Jira boards. Each ticket lists the metadata required, ultimate repository where the dataset will be preserved, when the data is expected, the location where the data should be in the Research Workspace, and the estimated effort for curating the dataset and upating the archive. Emails between IM the PIs can be forwarded to these tickets to keep dataset context attached to the ticket. 
### Confluence
Conflunece is an Atlassian knowledge management system that integrates with Jira. In Confluence, each data type has a page providing dataset context and a running work journal to provide a narrative of current and historical work to curate the dataset. 
Dataset context includes:
 - Project
 - PI
 - Other important contacts
 - Research Workspace link
 - Jira issue template (for annual datasets)
 - Links to all Jira tickets associated with the dataset
 - The DOI or DOIs associated with dataset
 - Links to other important context, e.g. github repos or project websites

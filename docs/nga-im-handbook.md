# Information Management handbook for NGA LTER

This document should describe all of the tools and processes needed for a new person to join the IM team. 

## Short summary

This will be easier to write once more of the doc in complete. It'll describe what's in scope for the IM team and what's not. 

## What we'll cover:
1. The tools we use
2. The general process for each dataset
3. People
4. The website
5. The bibliography
6. What else?

# NGA IM Tools

**[The Research Workspace](www.researchworkspace.com)** is used extensively by the site for controlled data storage and sharing with the site and external collaborators, authoring ISO 19115 metadata, and submitting archive-ready datasets to the Research Workspace DataONE Member Node. 

EML metadata is written using **[ezEML](https://ezeml.edirepository.org/)**.

The Information Manager uses Axiom's access to **Jira and Confluence** for task and project managment and internal IM documentation.

NGA LTER site data are archived in **DataONE Member Node Repositories**, where they are discoverable through DataONE's federated search portal and the **[NGA LTER Custom Portal](https://search.dataone.org/portals/NGALTER)**. Historically, site data were archived in the Research Workspace DataONE Member Node, but beginning in 2025 have begun to be archived in the **[EDI repository](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/advancedSearch.jsp)**. Results from the site modeling component are discoverable in the **[AOOS Ocean Data Explorer](https://portal.aoos.org/)**.

The **[NGA LTER Github organization](https://github.com/nga-lter)** is used to connect Github repositories used by site personnel for data QC and wrangling, analysis, or training.

For more a more detailed description of how we use these tools and systems, see **[NGA Information Management Tools](resources/im-tools.md)**. 

# NGA data processes
General process:
Ship --> lab/office --> RW --> Archive

![Flowchart illustrating the general workflow for NGA LTER data management. The diagram shows sequential steps: Ship to lab or office, then to Research Workspace, and finally to Archive. Arrows connect each step, indicating the flow of data. The environment is a clean, structured diagram with labeled boxes and directional arrows. The tone is neutral and informative. Text in the image: Ship, lab or office, RW, Archive.](./Figures/NGA_Interaction_Flowchart.drawio.png)

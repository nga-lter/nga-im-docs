# NGA IM Tools

**[The Research Workspace](www.researchworkspace.com)** is used extensively by the site for controlled data storage and sharing with the site and external collaborators, for authoring metadata, and for submitting data to The Research Workspace DataONE Member Node.

The Information Manager uses Axiom's access to **Jira and Confluence** for task and project managment, and internal IM documentation.

NGA LTER site data are archived in **DataONE Member Node Repositories**, where they are discoverable through DataONE's federated search portal and the **[NGA LTER Custom Portal](https://search.dataone.org/portals/NGALTER)**. Historically, site data were archived in the Research Workspace DataONE Member Node,but beginning in 2025 have begun to be archived in the **[EDI repository](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/advancedSearch.jsp)**. Results from the site modeling component are discoverable in the **[AOOS Ocean Data Explorer](https://portal.aoos.org/)**.

For more a more detailed description of how we use these tools and systems, see [NGA Information Management Tools](resources/im-tools.md).

# LTER Core Areas

This division of our measured parameters into the LTER Core Area categories is based on what CCE and PAL have already done.  
Ours don't match exactly, but here's how they split theirs up so we have something to start with:

## Disturbance Patterns
* weather stations
* sea level and anomalies
* water temperature
* sea ice

## Inorganic Matter
* dissolved inorganic nutrients
* dissolved iron
* DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon)
* DO (dissolved oxygen)
* Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria and Archaea Abundance

## Organic Matter:
* Bacteria
* DOC (Dissolved Organic Carbon)
* Sediment trap fluxes
* POC and PON (particulate organic carbon and nitrogen)
* total DOC and DON
* photosynthetic parameters from photosynthetic-irradiance curves

## Population Studies:
* birds (well, penguins)
* diet
* bacteria
* HPLC
* zooplankton
* mesozooplankton
* body lengths

## Primary Production:
* Chlorophyll
* HPLC pigments
* nitrate uptake
* size fractionated chlorophyll
* primary production
* dissolved oxygen
* photosynthetic parameters from photosynthetic-irradiance curves

## Signature
* 8 for PAL including chick counts, chlor, primary production, weather, ice, zooplankton
* 6 for CCE including zooplankton, primary production, and water temp
